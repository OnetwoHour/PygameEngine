# Pygame Game Engine

This project is a Pygame-based game engine developed for Lecture of the Introduction to Game Programming at Kyung Hee University.

## Features

1. **Procedural Terrain Generation**
   - Implemented procedurally generated terrain within the game.
   - Utilized terrain generation algorithms to create diverse landscapes.

2. **Bot Creation Mimicking Gradient Descent**
   - Developed bots that mimic gradient descent for navigation.
   - Bots can detect the terrain's gradient and attempt appropriate movement.

3. **Easy Camera Movement**
   - Implemented a simple camera movement that follows the player or important game elements.
   - The camera smoothly follows the player's movements.
